Wallâ€‘E: A 3D-Printed, ESP32-Powered Robot

Wallâ€‘E started as a simple ideaâ€”a dream to build a fully functional, 3D-printed robot** that could move, turn, and interact. Using a combination of **embedded programming, motor control, and custom-designed 3D parts**, we brought this vision to life. The robot is powered by an **ESP32 microcontroller, controlled via a web-based interface, and runs on a **DC motor and chain-driven system** for smooth mobility.  

One of the biggest challenges was optimizing torque** for movement, given the weight of the robot. Through multiple iterations, we refined the gear ratios, motor selection, and power distribution** to achieve the perfect balance of speed and strength. From designing the chassis and wheels to writing the motor control logic, this project was a deep dive into robotics, embedded systems, and 3D modeling. Now, it's open-source, meaning anyone can download the code and 3D models** to build their own version of Wallâ€‘E! ðŸ¤–
